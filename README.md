# Virtual File System Simulator
Welcome to GitHub repository!

# Overview:
The Virtual File System Simulator project is designed to emulate a basic file system within a virtual disk represented by a file (Disk.txt).This simulator allows users to perform essential file and directory operations similar to those available in a traditional operating system environment.

# Key Features:
## 1. Virtual Disk Representation:
  * The virtual disk is represented by a single file (Disk.txt), with a maximum size limit of 1MB.
  * The file serves as the storage medium for the simulated file system, encapsulating
  directories, files, and metadata.

## 2. FAT Table Management:
  * Manage file allocation using a FAT table.
## 3. File Operations:
  * CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on files within the virtual disk.
## 4. Directory Management: 
  * Support for directories and hierarchical file organization.
## 5. FAT Table Visualization:
  * Visual representation of the FAT table for allocation status.

# Technologies Used:
* **C#**: Core programming language used for the project.
* **.NET Framework**: Leveraging .NET for system and file I/O operations.
* **Console Application**: Project implemented as a command-line interface application.
* **Visual Studio**: IDE used for development and debugging.

# Purpose:
* The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in file system concepts and operations.
* It offers a simplified yet functional simulation of a file system, enabling users to understand fundamental file management tasks.
